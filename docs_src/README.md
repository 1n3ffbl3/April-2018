about the course:  
* workshops and visitors are fixed  
* lectures are quasi-fixed but can be flexible depending on the class's needs  
* try to keep your projects in sync with lectures, we can help you with that

You will be expected to show up prepared for code alongs. in lecture we will cover developer practices and soft skills, not syntax.  we will help you with that after class
